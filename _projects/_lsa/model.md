Given the assumption that the contents of a paper is valid, one can consider a paper to be a bag of concepts, where concepts are represented by an ordered set of words. I use binary variables from ngrams representing inclusion in a text. This is in an effort to remove author bias when discussing the contents of a paper, since authors discuss their personal interests in more depth and detail. By standardizing the feature extraction  binary inclusion variables, the model evenly weights all concepts that an author brings up.
