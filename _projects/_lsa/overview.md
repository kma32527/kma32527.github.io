## Latent semantic indexing as an exploratory tool
Because academic literature tends to be spell-checked with stanardized language, academia is particularly well-suited to text analysis. Authors of texts tend to utilize and draw connections to a wide range of concepts that are relevant to their work to clearly explain their results, which can be picked up on by clustering documents based on lexical choice.

In particular, research papers frequently come attached with an abstract-- a summarization of the important points and results of the paper. One can consider an abstract to be an informationally dense representation of the contents of a paper, where only the most important key points are discussed. Thus, this allows for a representation of topical similarity between research articles based on the lexical choice authors use in writing the abstract.
