## Naively exploring academic literature with latent semantic analysis
Because academic literature tends to be spell-checked with stanardized language, scientific research is particularly well-suited to text analysis. Authors of texts tend to utilize and draw connections to a wide range of concepts that are relevant to their work in an attempt to clearly explain their results. 

Given the assumption that the contents of a paper is valid, one can consider a paper to be a bag of concepts, joined at the main objective of the paper. This allows for a heuristic interpretation of concepts as they appear in a paper; if an author refers to a concept in a paper, that concept is most likely related to the objective of the paper.
