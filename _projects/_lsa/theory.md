## Model details
Given the assumption that the contents of a paper is valid, one can consider a paper to be a bag of concepts, where concepts are represented by 

- i use binary variables from ngrams representing inclusion in a text. This is in an effort to remove author bias when discussing the contents of a paper, since authors discuss their personal interests in more depth and detail. By standardizing the feature extraction  binary inclusion variables, the model evenly weights all concepts that an author brings up.
- This allows for a more objective, unbiased look into the underlying structure of the concepts themselves. In particular, scientists incorporate math because it works without understanding *why* the math is representative of the underlying principles. However, by discussing the mathematics at all, authors essentially establish a logical relation between some scientific concept, and a mathematical structure describing its behaviour. This can be picked up in a naive manner with binary feature extraction, which has the added bonus of removing the need for the author to understand the mathematics sufficiently to discuss it in depth.
- I believe that clustering scientific papers on mathematical terms and concepts would allow us to build a better intuitive framework of mathematics and how it connects to the world around us.
