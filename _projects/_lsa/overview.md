## Naively exploring academic literature with latent semantic analysis
Because academic literature tends to be spell-checked with stanardized language, scientific research is particularly well-suited to text analysis. Authors of texts tend to utilize and draw connections to a wide range of concepts that are relevant to their work in an attempt to clearly explain their results. 

Given the assumption that the contents of a paper is valid, one can consider a paper to be a bag of concepts, where concepts are represented by logical statements on a vocabulary. One can consider these logical statements as samples from the set of all valid logical statements on a vocabulary. The set of all valid logical statements on a vocabulary represents the hypothetical state of "perfect knowledge"
